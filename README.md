NOTES
-----

`Wallpapers:`
 
    Due to not owning the licesnces for any of the wallpapers displayed in screenshots they will be 
    removed from the File tree. To Combat the nessesity to Manually edit the lua theme i have created
    a wallaper changer to the configs it will list your wallpapers and aplly the wallpaper and restart
    awesome automaticly for you.
    How to use this function:
    mkdir ~/.config/awesome/wallpaper
    Fill this directory with Wallpapers and select the wall paper you want from the Awesome Menu
    (NOTE Awesome Soft restart maybe required if you cans see your images in the menu.)

`Scripts:`

    Please Keep in mind if you download these configs and scripts they are currently in beta what works for 
    me may not work for you nessisarily you are ofcourse welcome to open up issues and please makesure you 
    give detailed log output and explinations for the issues. Currently Most of the Scripts are designed 
    for working with Archlinux (i.e Pacman and Aur Updates) but im working on making it more distro indipendant. 
    Enjoy :)
