NOTES
-----

`Wallpapers:`
    
    Due to not owning the licesnces for any of the wallpapers displayed in screenshots they will be removed from the File tree so you will be required to make some changes to the ./themes/default/theme.lua

`Scripts:`

    Please Keep in mind if you download these configs and scripts they are currently in beta what works for me may not work for you nessisarily you are ofcourse welcome to open up issues and please makesure you give detailed log output and explinations for the issues. Currently Most of the Scripts are designed for working with Archlinux (i.e Pacman and Aur Updates) but im working on making it more distro indipendant. Enjoy :)
